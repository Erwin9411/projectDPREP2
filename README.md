# The E-Commerce Retail Market - Bol.com versus Amazon.nl

__Bol.com and Amazon.nl on the Dutch E-commerce retail market. Does price influence perceived quality?__

## Motivation

Motivate your research question or business problem. Clearly explain which problem is solved.

Amazon.nl is making its appearance on the e-commerce retail market in the Netherlands. Bol.com is one of the  bigger parties on the Dutch e-commerce retail market at  the moment. Both companies sell a wide variety of  products including smartphones. The goal of this project is to look if the price of a smartphone has influence on the perceived quality of that smartphone. More precisely if there is a correlation between price and star rating for smartphones for bol.com and Amazon.nl.

## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

The method that is chosen is linear regression. This method is used to predict the influence of the independent variable price on the dependend variable perceived quality. Perceived quality is expressed in the star-rating. By using linear regression there can, or can not, be concluded if there is a correlation between the variables and what the exact linear regression is. With this information the research question is answered. 

## Repository overview

Provide an overview of the directory structure and files.

## Running instructions

Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. Touch upon, if necessary, the required input data, which (secret) credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## More resources

Point interested users to any related literature and/or documentation.

An aspect that is related to this research is the price-quality inference. This is a psychological aspect of pricing where there is a preference for a more expensive option. The aspect states that a higher price signals that the perceived quality is better (Smith, 2021). This is an aspect that might be related to the research and therefore might be interesting for interested users.
