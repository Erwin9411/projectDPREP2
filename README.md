# Short project title

__Long project title, e.g., research question__

## Motivation

Motivate your research question or business problem. Clearly explain which problem is solved.

Amazon.nl is making its appearance on the webshop market in the Netherlands. Bol.com is one of the bigger parties on the Dutch market at the moment.  Both companies sell smartphones. The goal of this project is to look if the different brands differ in average price / average star rating on both e-commerce sites. 

## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.
